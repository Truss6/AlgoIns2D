# AlgoIns2D
Algorithmic Insertion Two Dimensional

AlgoIns2D is written to import complex geometry into solid mechanics simulations, It is written to allow for varying sizes of polygons to be created, allowing for low resolution in homogeneous regions (interior/exterior) while allowing for a high level of refinement at the surface, while also mantaining a continuous surface by splitting squares into several triangles at the highest level of refinement.

The algorithm is quite fast for tens of throusands of polygons, but plotting is slow. See example of the algorithm used on the mandelbraught set and results.

This is not a meshing program.
